# Descriptions

I've created this Fibonacci Series app (Console version) to have fun with coding, And it reminds me my great memories of unversity era.
I hope you see my codes, give me your feedbacks to help me improve my programming skill and being a better programmer!
Please enjoy...

--- Attention ---
I will be back with visual version of this app...
